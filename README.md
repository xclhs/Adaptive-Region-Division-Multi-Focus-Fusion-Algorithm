RDMF: An Adaptive Region Division Multi-Focus Image Fusion Algorithm with Defocus Diffusion Mitigation Mechanism

## Abstract

This paper introduces the Adaptive Region Division Multi-Focus Fusion (RDMF) algorithm to mitigate issues caused by the defocus spread effect. RDMF combines image gradient information with morphological features to comprehensively measure image activity levels. Subsequently, RDMF effectively resolves common fusion challenges, including defocus spread effects and boundary artifacts, by rectifying defocus spread effects near focus boundaries, addressing internal errors within regions, and refining boundary transitions between fused regions. Experiment result on real-world datasets consistently highlight RDMFâ€™s efficacy in preserving sharp image details while effectively mitigating the defocus spread effect.
